Hdlparse
========

Hdlparse is a simple package implementing a rudimentary parser for VHDL. It is not capable of fully parsing the entire language. Rather, it is meant to extract enough key information from a source file to create generated documentation.


Requirements
------------

Hdlparse requires either Python 2.7 or Python 3.x and no additional libraries.

The installation script depends on setuptools. The source is written in
Python 2.7 syntax but will convert cleanly to Python 3 when the installer
passes it through 2to3.


Download
--------

You can access the Hdlparse Git repository from `Github
<https://github.com/kevinpt/hdlparse>`_. You can install direct from PyPI with the "pip"
command if you have it available.


Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is available online at the `main Hdlparse site
<http://kevinpt.github.io/hdlparse/>`_.
